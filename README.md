## About This Repository

This repository contains software engineering projects developed during my externship with Tesla through the Headstarter Fellowship program. Working under Tesla Engineers, I contributed to various initiatives including:

- **Maps & Vehicle Software** - Navigation systems and routing algorithms
- **Tesla Open Source Contributions** - Vehicle Command protocols and implementations
- **Production-Grade Systems** - Real-world applications demonstrating industry best practices
